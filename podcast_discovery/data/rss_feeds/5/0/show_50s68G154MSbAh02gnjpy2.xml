		<description><![CDATA[ Black History isn't discussed enough socially or by structured educational systems. It's especially important because if we understand the plights of those who were oppressed, and observe their solutions, we could advance further as people when faced with similar situations. This ideal truly validates Santayana's quote, "Those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it." The same information has been in circulation for years, it’s time to give lesser-known historical figures the homage they rightfully deserve.

Students will perform better when they can identify with and relate to their teachers. Minority teachers are in a position to put a stop to negative stereotypes and act as role models and mentors for students of color.

			<title><![CDATA[Maternal Mortality & Rebecca L. Crumpler]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode, we draw extreme correlations between history and modern day social issues involving patient care provided to POC . I’m starting to think when we say  "Buy the whole block” or” We need more black doctors,” people think it’s infeasible. If Dr. Crumpler provided medical care to our ancestors during slavery, why can’t we do it for each other today? 2019 is another year of socio-economic disparities for African-Americans, but we have people in the 1800’s who fought for education and rose to success, sometimes we need to see someone else’s struggle and plight to get inspired, which is okay, that’s why I’m here. There’s probably a black kid today that feels inferior due to their environmental circumstances and may feel reluctant to go to medical school, and I say to you think about Rebecca L. Crumpler and how she fought racism to administer help to her people. 


**Sidenote I could not resist the urge to say pill throughout this episode or something but I meant "IMPLANT" lol, enjoy the show :)

			<description><![CDATA[If you recently lost a loved one, you may want to think twice before taking smoking or taking another drink. Drugs and alcohol are merely bandages on a wound when it comes to grief, and is strongly considered “Self Medication”. As black people, we do not allow ourselves to handle mental health issues, and society plays a HUGE role in the suppression of black mental health. Check out my most recent episode of an “An Echo of The Past” and listen to how @devthe_voice and I provide tips about handling grief.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Maggie L. Walker led by example, While many of the largest black-owned banks went under during the Great Depression, Walker’s bank survived, in part by merging with two smaller, black-owned banks in 1930, when it was renamed Consolidated Bank &amp; Trust. Today, Consolidated has assets of $116 million, and the majority of its shareholders, who include two of Walker’s descendants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black Americans need to revisit group economics immediately. So what does that mean for us? We need to actively support each other on the journey of achieving financial freedom. We need to teach ourselves and our children about life. Ranging from setting up successful investment portfolios to avoiding unhealthy eating habits.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Introduction to HistoryBai: An Echo Of The Past Podcast ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I want to emphasize the importance of Black History. Black History isn't discussed enough socially or by structured educational systems. It's especially important because if we understand the plights of those who were oppressed, and observe their solutions, we could advance further as people when faced with similar situations. This ideal truly validates Santayana's quote, "Those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it." &nbsp;The same information has been in circulation for years, its time to give lesser-known historical figures the homage they rightfully deserve.</p>
