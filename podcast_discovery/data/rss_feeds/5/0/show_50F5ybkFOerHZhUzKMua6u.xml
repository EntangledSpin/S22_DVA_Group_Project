			<description><![CDATA[This week we sat down with Clarissa Corey Bey or (as they’re known on social media) Sweet: a non binary, black, queer artist and musical director of the energetic and cosmic group Black Folks Don’t Swim? We discussed food, music, the process of creation, staying accessible and inclusive, and how being at the intersection of many identities keeps a person cognizant of others’ realities. And of course...communication blocks!
