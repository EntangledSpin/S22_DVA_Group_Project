			<title><![CDATA[Byronic]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Byronic is an adjective that means moody and melodramatic.</p>
<p>19th century poet Lord Byron provides the origin of our word of the day. He was a romantic English poet known for poetry that was full of melancholy and intense drama. Byronic may be used to describe poetry of this kind, or can be used more broadly to describe anything, like as a person’s behavior, that fits such a description. For example: Catherine’s been acting more Byronic lately. She’s been in a moody frame of mind all week.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Gimcrack]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Gimcrack is a noun that refers to something cheap and showy but of little use or an adjective that means showy but worthless.</p>
<p>Our word of the day’s origin is uncertain, but it seems to have common ground with words from Middle English that refer to furniture that is ornamental, but serves no practical purpose. Gimcrack has retained this same meaning today. For example: All those decorative gimcracks on Nigel’s guitar may have looked cute, but they didn’t disguise the fact that he wasn’t a very good player.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Prestidigitation]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Prestidigitation is a noun that means sleight of hand.</p>
<p>Our word of the day gets its origin by combining presto (PRESS toe) the Italian word for ‘quick’ and &nbsp;digitus (DEE gee toos) the Latin word for ‘finger.’ Often used to describe the work of magicians, prestidigitation can also be used in other contexts, such as: I was fooled by the thief’s prestidigitation. If I hadn’t seem him secretly put a candy bar in his pocket, I would have never known what was happening.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Bowdlerize]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bowdlerize is a verb that means to expurgate by omit parts considered vulgar.</p>
<p>Our word of the day’s origin begins with a 19th century English physician named Thomas Bowdler. In 1818, Bowdler published a book called “Family Shakespeare” with the intention of omitting “those words which cannot with propriety be read aloud in a family.” The book was successful with the general public, but literary and theatre critics weren’t as happy with what he’d done to The Bard’s work.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the word bowdlerize to enter English as a way of describing the doctor’s act. In fact, it appeared prior to his death in 1825.</p>
<p>I really hope the producers don’t bowdlerize my writing. Omitting vulgar words from it would seriously harm my artistic intentions.</p>

<p>Placebo has its origin in the Latin words for ‘I will please.’ Nocebo’s origin is in the phrase “I will harm.”</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Materfamilias is a noun that refers to the female head of the household.</p>
<p>Our word is a combination of two Latin words. Mater (MAH ter) meaning ‘mother,’ and familia (fa MEEL ee uh) meaning ‘family.’ Together they give us a word for a female who heads the household.</p>
<p>As the materfamilias of a large Greek family, my mother knows a great deal about how to manage people who can be a little wild.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dilapidated is an adjective that means decayed or fallen into partial ruin.</p>
<p>Lapis (LAP eese) is the Latin word for stone. By adding the prefix D-I, we get the word for ‘pelt with stones.’ From there, it evolved into a word that means ‘destroyed from stones.’ More recently, it simply means decayed or destroyed — but not necessarily from stones.</p>
<p>I can’t believe Rosemary wasted her money on that old dilapidated building. Purchasing an old decaying property can only pay off if you invest a lot of time and money into repairing it.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[Pollyanna is a noun that refers to a naively optimistic person. 

Our word of the day comes from a 1913 novel by Elinor Porter. Pollyanna is both the name of the novel and the protagonist who is characterized by an irrepressible optimism and a tendency to see the good in everything. It is best used to refer to people whose optimism is foolish and perhaps dangerous. 

I like Karry, but she can be something of a pollyanna. One of these days her optimistic view of life is going to lead her into something horrible.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Bacchanal is a noun that means a wild drunken celebration. It can also be an adjective that means related to the god of wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacchus is the Greek god of wine and revelry. Our word of the day may be used &amp;nbsp;as an adjective to refer to this deity, but is most frequently used to refer to a party or celebration that is very much in the spirit of Bacchus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin used to live a pretty wild life. He often spent weeks jumping from one bacchanal to another.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Abet]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Abet is a verb that means to aid or assist in doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Our word of the day began life in Middle English where it meant, ‘to urge to do something.’ Abet is frequently used in a legal context where the thing one is urged to do is usually illegal. But outside of the legal world, its meaning can be broader, for example: I didn’t want to abet Mike’s unhealthy eating habits. But I figured cooking him a plate of food heavy in carbs every once in a while was a harmless thing to do.</p>

<p>Our word of the day is of Sanskrit origin and is commonly used among Buddhists to describe a means of attaining a happy life. But it can be used more broadly to simply refer to compassion.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Redbrick is an adjective that means working class or lacking prestige.</p>
<p>Our word of the day combines the two common English words, ‘red’ and ‘brick’ in reference to a kind of material used to construct buildings. Because redbrick is a more recent development, it means that a building created from it lacks the prestige of an older building. It is most commonly used to refer to less prestigious colleges or universities.</p>
<p>My father didn’t have the status to attend an older prestigious university like Cambridge or Oxford, so he had to settle for a redbrick school. Attending a more blue color university may have hurt him at the time, but he now has no regrets.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Interdict]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Interdict is a verb that means to prohibit or stop. It can also be used as a noun that refers to a prohibition.</p>
<p>Our word of the day is of Latin origin. It combines the prefix I-N-T-E-R, meaning ‘between’ and</p>
<p>dicere, (DEE chair ay) meaning ‘to say’ or ‘to speak.’</p>
<p>In the past, anyone guilty of violating an interdict was subject to being cut off from having privileges from or attending, the Catholic church. In more recent years the word is used in contexts with less severe punishments.</p>
<p>An example of interdict as a noun would be: The office interdict forbade the use of use cell phones during working hours. As a verb, an example is: I understand why they wouldn’t want people talking excessively on their phone, but it seems a little extreme to interdict cell phone use altogether.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Interdict is a verb that means to prohibit or stop. It can also be used as a noun that refers to a prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day is of Latin origin. It combines the prefix I-N-T-E-R, meaning ‘between’ and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dicere, (DEE chair ay) meaning ‘to say’ or ‘to speak.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, anyone guilty of violating an interdict was subject to being cut off from having privileges from or attending, the Catholic church. In more recent years the word is used in contexts with less severe punishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of interdict as a noun would be: The office interdict forbade the use of use cell phones during working hours. As a verb, an example is: I understand why they wouldn’t want people talking excessively on their phone, but it seems a little extreme to interdict cell phone use altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Propinquity]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Propinquity is a noun that means nearness or proximity.</p>
<p>The Latin word prope (PRO pay) which means ‘near’ has given birth to our word of the day and its cousin ‘proximity.’ Propinquity is the older member of the family, having entered English in the 14th century.</p>
<p>Both words are roughly translated to ‘nearness’ but propinquity often conveys a sense of being closer than just ‘in the vicinity’ which is what proximity usually means. For example: As much as I loved the proximity of the football stadium a few blocks away, the propinquity of the hammock in the back yard made for a more relaxing afternoon.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Imprecation]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Imprecation is a noun that refers to a curse.</p>
<p>The Latin word precari (pray CAR ee) means ‘to pray, ask or request.’ The addition of the prefix I-N gets us a word that can be thought of as the opposite of a prayer — in other words, a curse. The word be used to describe the actions of a figure like a witch or a warlock, but it can also be used more informally. For example: Brenda may have smiled when faced with all the extra work she had to do, but under her breath, she muttered many imprecations to her co-workers whose laziness caused her to work late.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Panoply is a noun that refers to a magnificent or impressive array.</p>
<p>The Greek word panoplia (pan oh PLEE uh) referred the full set of armor worn by Greek infantry guards. It combined the prefix PAN, meaning ‘all’ with hopla (HOPE la) meaning ‘armor.’ By the 17th century the word had entered the English language and its meaning had extended to mean ‘a full set’ of something that may or may not have anything to do with armor.</p>
<p>I was happy to see a panoply of food options at the banquet. With such a dazzling array of choices, I was sure everybody would find something to eat.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Phlegmatic]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Phlegmatic is an adjective that means having a calm, composed temperament.</p>
<p>You may recognize the word phlegm, as in the bodily fluid, in our word of the day. It turns out there is a connection. So how did phlegm come to be associated with a synonym of ‘calm’ and ‘stoic?’ The answer goes back to the ancient Greeks. They believed that human personalities were controlled by four bodily fluids called humors: Blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm. Those ruled by phlegm were thought of as calm and unemotional. Centuries later, we would refer to such people as ‘the phlegmatic type.’</p>
<p>Charlie’s phlegmatic personality made him an ideal person to be around in times of crises. No matter how crazy things would get, he would remain cool and unemotional.</p>

<p>Karpos (CAR pose) is the Greek word for fruit. The addition of the prefix A turns it into ‘fruitless.’ Our word of the day may refer to actual food but it may be used to mean any living creature that produces no offspring. It may also be used metaphorically to mean ‘unproductive’ or ‘futile.’ For example: The purpose of the meeting was to generate new ideas for the spring sale, but we couldn’t think of any. I had no idea the meeting would turn out to be so acarpous.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Hermetic]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hermetic is an adjective that means airtight or not affected by outside influence.</p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Hermes was the god of science and art. So it makes sense that the scientific discovery of an airtight tube would be credited to him. The word Hermetic is named for him.</p>
<p>The word is generally used in a scientific context, but it can also be used more informally as in: if we don’t want the milk to spoil, we should put it into a hermetic container. Using something airtight is the only solution.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Crestfallen is an adjective that means dispirited or humiliated.</p>
<p>Our word of the day began life in the late 16th century, originating with a reference to a mammal or bird having a fallen or drooping crest. An animal’s crest refers to its head. Having a drooping head is an indication that an animal — or person — is dejected.</p>
<p>The loss left Harold crestfallen for weeks. You wouldn’t think the results of a ping pong game would be so devastating, but Harold took the sport very seriously.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Luddite is a noun that refers to a person who avoids the use of new technology.</p>
<p>It’s not certain which language our word of the day comes from but we know the term was first used to describe a group of textile mill workers in Nottingham, England in the early 19th century who rioted for the destruction of new machinery that was slowly replacing them. A man known as Ned Ludd seemed to be involved in the movement.</p>
<p>In more recent years, the word is used to describe anyone who is opposed to, or uncomfortable with, technology.</p>
<p>I used to be a luddite but getting an iPhone for my birthday has cured me. From now on, I’ll never oppose technology again.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Luddite is a noun that refers to a person who avoids the use of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not certain which language our word of the day comes from but we know the term was first used to describe a group of textile mill workers in Nottingham, England in the early 19th century who rioted for the destruction of new machinery that was slowly replacing them. A man known as Ned Ludd seemed to be involved in the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more recent years, the word is used to describe anyone who is opposed to, or uncomfortable with, technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be a luddite but getting an iPhone for my birthday has cured me. From now on, I’ll never oppose technology again.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The Latin word tenuare (TEN ooh are ay) means ‘to make thin.’ Combined with the prefix EX, we get the basis of our word of the day. Extenuate is often used in a legal context as in ‘extenuating circumstances,’ but you don’t need to be in a courtroom to find a use for it. For example: I didn’t think anything could extenuate the damage from the flood. But it turned out that all I had to do was soak up the floor with rags and harm was immediately eased.</p>

<p>Our word of the day has its origin in Latin, where the word mephitis (MEH fit iss) means ‘noxious vapor.’ It is also personified as a goddess believed to have the power to avert it. Today mephitis retains its original meaning and mephitic may be used to describe something related to mephitis or it may be used more broadly to refer to anything foul-smelling.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrate is a verb that means to use the mind or reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may recognize the Latin derived ‘cerebrum — a synonym of ‘brain’ — as cerebrate’s root word. Our word of the day simply adds the suffix ATE to indicate a state or function. It’s hard to cerebrate with all the noise going on outside. I’ll need more quiet if I hope to put my mind to use.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Achates]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Achates is a noun that refers to a faithful friend.</p>
<p>Our word of the day comes from an epic poem called Aeneid. In the story, Achates accompanies a Trojan leader named Aeneas everywhere in his adventures. Prior to being featured in the poem by Vergil, both characters originated in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>When trying out a new standup comedy routine, I like to rehearse it in front of an Achates or two. Only a faithful friend will have the courage to tell you when you’re not funny.</p>

<p>You may recognize ‘franchise’ as the root of our word of the day. It comes from the Latin word franc (fronk) meaning ‘free.’ With the addition of the prefix A — which means ‘to’ — it becomes a transitive verb that means something done to someone, as in: After watching a documentary on animal cruelty, Amy affranchised her chickens. Setting them free after years of service seemed like the least she could do.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Disport]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Disport is mainly used as a verb that means to divert or amuse, but less commonly, it can be a noun that refers to a sport.</p>
<p>Our word of the day is derived from the Latin portare (poor TAR ay) meaning ‘to carry.’ From here, the word picked up the prefix DIS and became disport which meant ‘to carry away,’ ‘comfort’ or ‘entertain.’</p>
<p>This versatile word can refer to a pastime, but in that sense it has been surpassed in popularity by its shortened version ‘sport.’ It can also mean to amuse or divert. For example: These days it’s a little harder to disport kids. It often takes a lot of imagination and money to find something they consider amusing.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Calliopean is an adjective that means loud and piercing.</p>
<p>In Greek mythology, the muses were nine sisters who presided over various arts and sciences, with each muse having a different area of expertise. The Muse named Calliope presided over heroic poetry. In time, the word calliope came to be the name of a steam-powered musical instrument known for being extremely loud. The adjective calliopean may refer either specifically to the musical instrument or to anything piercingly loud.</p>
<p>Just when I thought I’d found a nice quiet time to take a nap, my son began to practice the drums, creating a calliopean noise and guaranteeing I wouldn’t get a wink of sleep.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Calliopean is an adjective that means loud and piercing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greek mythology, the muses were nine sisters who presided over various arts and sciences, with each muse having a different area of expertise. The Muse named Calliope presided over heroic poetry. In time, the word calliope came to be the name of a steam-powered musical instrument known for being extremely loud. The adjective calliopean may refer either specifically to the musical instrument or to anything piercingly loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when I thought I’d found a nice quiet time to take a nap, my son began to practice the drums, creating a calliopean noise and guaranteeing I wouldn’t get a wink of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Gordian]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Gordian is an adjective that means intricate or difficult to solve. It can also be used as a noun that refers to the Gordian knot of legend.</p>
<p>According to tales of yore, Gordios (GORE dee ose) the king of Gordium, tied an intricate knot and prophesied that whoever untied it would be the ruler of Asia. It was cut through by the sword of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>Today, the word may still be used when retelling this legend, but it is more likely to be used as a synonym for words like complicated, intricate or convoluted. The health clinic gave great service, but they had a very gordian system. Even something as simple as getting prescribed an aspirin would demand navigating through an elaborate maze of paperwork.</p>

<p>Our word of the day comes directly from German, where it means ‘replacement.’ Ersatz is typically used in a context that implies the replacement is inferior to the real thing. Example: Terry’s ersatz bow tie may have looked convincing to most people, but it didn’t fool me. A real bow tie would have been a much more elegant addition to the evening.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Spartan]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spartan may be used as an adjective that means marked by strict self-discipline. It may also be used as a noun that refers to a person of strict discipline.</p>
<p>Our word of the day’s first meaning was as a reference to any resident of the ancient Greek city-state Sparta. Sparta was known for having a highly disciplined way of life for all of its citizens — men and women — to keep them ready for war at any time.</p>
<p>In modern times, the word can be a noun that refers to a person with a strict sense of discipline. Here’s an example of the word used in adjective form: As much as I’d love to have a body that resembles Tony’s, his Spartan lifestyle intimidates me. I don’t think I have the discipline needed to engage in as much exercise as he does.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Gest is a noun that refers to a tale or adventure.</p>
<p>Our word of the day is not to be confused with jest, JEST, but both words share a common ancestor. The Latin gestus (JEST oos) the past participle of the verb ‘to bear’ or ‘to carry’ has given birth to many words like ingest, suggest and ingest as well as jest with a J and gest with a G.</p>
<p>As much as I love Shakespeare’s warm romantic comedies, my favorites are the ones that feature brave men engaged in a gest. There’s something about a good old adventure tale that thrills me.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Ligneous]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ligneous is an adjective that means of or resembling wood.</p>
<p>Our word of the day began with the Latin word lignum (LEAN yoom) which simply means ‘wood.’ Its descendant ligneous may be used in a literal sense to refer to actual wood or something that looks like wood, and it may also be used to describe something that is ‘wooden’ in the figurative sense — as in a ‘wooden’ expression. For example: “The Judge’s ligneous expression was a bad sign. Whenever a judge shows no emotion, that means he has an unfavorable sentence to hand down.’</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Misprision is a noun that means the neglect or wrong performance of official duty.</p>
<p>The Latin word prehendere (PREN dare ay) means ‘to seize’ or ‘to take.’ As the word drifted through Middle English, the prefix MIS was added and the word evolved into our word of the day. In addition to its most common meaning, Misprision may be used in a few legal contexts like: ‘concealment of treason or felony by one who is not a participant in the treason or felony’ or ‘seditious conduct against the government or courts.’</p>
<p>When that security guard followed that suspicious man to his car, he may have thought he was helping out, but really he was engaging in an act of misprision. His job was simply to report unusual behavior.</p>

<p>Our word of the day is from the Latin Machina (MOCK ee nah) where it roughly translates to ‘machine’ — but its meaning is different than the way ‘machine’ is used in the contemporary sense. Instead it refers to ‘a contrivance’ or ‘something created.’ To machinate is to contrive or create a scheme. The word is often used in a pejorative sense. For example:</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Foible is a noun that means a minor shortcoming is someone's character.</p>
<p>In fencing, the word forte refers to the strongest point of the blade. So understandably, forte became a word to describe a person’s strongest skill or characteristic, as in: Jeff’s forte is public speaking. That’s why he’s done so well performing lectures at college.</p>
<p>By contrast, the foible (derived from the Old French word for ‘feeble.’) is the weakest part of the blade. And Foible refers to the person's weakest trait or skill. I don’t know why Mable insists on doing a dance routine for the talent show. Everybody knows dancing is her foible.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Doldrums]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Doldrums is a noun that refers to a slump or a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>The exact etymology of our word of the day is unknown, but we know it was first used as a nautical term to describe periods of time without strong winds — which was a problem for sailing vessels.</p>
<p>Today, the word is used in a similar way to describe periods of stagnation or the absence of inspiration.</p>
<p>Without any inspiration, Stacy has been in the doldrums for a while. That’s why she hasn’t painted a masterpiece in a while.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Begrudge]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Begrudge is a verb that means to envy or resent someone's good fortune.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the word ‘grudge’ nested in our word of the day. Derived from Middle English, grudge is perhaps best known as a noun that means ‘ill will or resentment resulting from a past insult or injury.’ But grudge is also a verb that can mean ‘to be resentfully unwilling to grant or give something.’ Adding the prefix BE to our word of the day gets us to begrudge which can mean ‘to reluctantly give.’ But its most common meaning is ‘to envy or resent someone’s success or fortune.’ The key word with all these is ‘resent.’</p>
<p>I get the feeling Tommy begrudges the success I’ve had at the office. He shook my hand to congratulate me on my raise, but I could tell by the resentment in his eyes that he didn’t mean it.</p>

<p>A fairly recent addition to English our word of the day came about in the mid-twentieth century, apparently from the word shambles, meaning ‘a state of total disorder.’ The shambolic state of my son’s room was always a source of puzzlement. I have no idea how I could have a child who has inherited none of my desire for order and neatness.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, a chimera is a fire-breathing monster that has a lion’s head, a goat’s body and a dragon’s tail. After being slain, this beast continued to live on in people’s imagination.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Chameleonic is an adjective that means given to quick or frequent change.</p>
<p>A chameleon is a lizard known for its ability to change colors. It gets its name from a combination of the Greek words chamai (HAHM eye) which means ‘on the ground’ and leōn (LAY own) meaning ‘lion.’</p>
<p>Our word of the day is the adjective form of the word that describes someone or something capable of changing colors or some other attribute.</p>
<p>Julie may have great principles, but she can be chameleonic when the situation demands it. I’ve seen her change opinions on many topics just to be liked by others.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Chameleonic is an adjective that means given to quick or frequent change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chameleon is a lizard known for its ability to change colors. It gets its name from a combination of the Greek words chamai (HAHM eye) which means ‘on the ground’ and leōn (LAY own) meaning ‘lion.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day is the adjective form of the word that describes someone or something capable of changing colors or some other attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie may have great principles, but she can be chameleonic when the situation demands it. I’ve seen her change opinions on many topics just to be liked by others.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Canorous is an adjective that means pleasant sounding or melodious.</p>
<p>Our word of the day’s origin is in the Latin word canere (Can AIR ay) which means ‘to sing.’ It’s often used in a musical context, but it can also be used to describe a lovely sound that has a vaguely music feel to it. For example: Spring is my favorite season. I love waking up to the canorous sounds of the birds collecting outside my window.</p>

<p>The Latin word for ‘perceive’ is percipere (PAIR chee paire ay). When used as an adjective, our word of the day is a synonym of ‘discerning,’ as in: when it comes to shopping for my clothes, I trust my wife’s judgement more than mine. She is a very percipient shopper.</p>
<p>As a noun, percipient, may refer simply to anyone who perceives things or it may specifically refer to someone with special powers to perceive, such a psychic: Tanya wanted to know where things were headed in her career, so she hired a percipient to read her future.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Malapropism]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The word is sometimes shortened to malaprop, which is spelled MALAPROP. Malapropism is a noun that refers to a humorously misused word or phrase.</p>
<p>Our word of the day has its origin in a 1775 play called The Rivals. It featured a character named Mrs. Malaprop who had a habit of verbal blunders, such as: ‘He is the very pineapple of politeness.’</p>
<p>The play’s writer, Richard Sheridan created the name from the French term mal à propos (MAL uh pro poh) which means ‘inappropriate.’</p>
<p>The Senator isn’t known for his ability to make people laugh — at least not intentionally. He often gets huge laughs from the occasional malapropism in his speeches.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Expiate is a verb that means to make amends for.</p>
<p>Our word of the day began life with the Latin word expiare, which means ‘to atone for.’ Before arriving in contemporary English, it had other meanings. Shakespeare (and others in his time) used the word to mean ‘to put an end to.’ But more recently, expiate is typically used in a context related to guilt or guilty behavior. For example:</p>
<p>Tom felt guilty for embezzling his company’s money, but he feels a great deal better after repaying the company the money. It felt refreshing to expiate for his crime.</p>

<p>Our boss is constantly reminding us of the basilic nature of this recent exhibit. He says its success would greatly enhance the museum’s reputation.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Basilic is an adjective that means royal or of great importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word basilikḗ (BAH seal eek) means ‘royal building.’ As the word evolved through Latin and French, it retained the same basic meaning. To this day, a basilica may refer to a giant church. Our word of the day has a broader meaning that may refer to anything of giant significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our boss is constantly reminding us of the basilic nature of this recent exhibit. He says its success would greatly enhance the museum’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Euchre is a verb that means to cheat or trick.</p>
<p>The precise etymology of our word of the day is not known, but we do know it was, and is, the name of a card game in which a person has to win three tricks to win a hand. Those who dishonestly prevent someone from winning three tricks are cheating. From this origin, comes euchre’s definition of ‘to swindle.’</p>
<p>That guy I met at the racetrack, seemed trustworthy, like someone who would never cheat me out of money. But he later tried to euchre me out of my life savings, by offering to sell me the Statue of Liberty.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Distend]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Distend is a verb that means to extend or stretch.</p>
<p>The Latin word tendere (TEN dare ay) means ‘to stretch.’ By combining it with the prefix ‘DIS’ meaning ‘apart,’ we get the basis for our word of the day. Distend may be used in a medical context to refer to, for example, ‘a distended finger,’ or it can refer to something a person does, as in: I would like to distend our tent so that all five people may fit inside. If we aren’t able to stretch it out, we might have to cancel our trip.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Repletion]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Repletion is a noun that refers to the condition of being filled to excess.</p>
<p>Repletion comes from the Latin repletionem (rep play TONE aim) meaning ‘to fill.’ While the word has retained this definition, it has over the years, acquired the additional meaning of ‘a state of being filled to excess.’ This is true whether the ‘filled’ object is a room or a belly, as in ‘I can’t recall ever feeling the repletion I’ve felt after yesterday’s dinner. I ate so much, I may not get hungry again until next week.</p>
<p>Once again, repletion is spelled REPLETION.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Officious]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Officious is an adjective that means meddlesome or overly eager to offer unwanted advice.</p>
<p>Our word of the day comes almost directly from the Latin word ‘officiosus (oh fish ee OH soos) meaning ‘obliging’ or ‘eager to serve.’ But in more recent centuries, officious has also come to mean ‘doing more than is asked or expected’ or ‘meddlesome.’</p>
<p>An example of the second meaning is: Larry is a great assistant, but he can get a little officious at times. For example, a few weeks ago, he not only delivered flowers to my wife when we had an argument, but he also apologized on my behalf.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Desuetude]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Desuetude is a noun that means discontinuance from use or exercise.</p>
<p>Our word of the day is a distant relative of the Latin verb suescere (sue ay SHARE ay) meaning ‘to accustom.’ With the prefix DE — which means ‘away’ — the word later evolved to mean ‘a state of not being used.’ Desuetude is a synonym of disuse, but its more ‘old world’ sound may make it a more appropriate word when you need something more sentimental. For example:</p>
<p>In my younger days, I rode my bike all the time. But since buying my car a few years ago, my reliable old 10-speed has fallen into desuetude.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Herculean is an adjective that means requiring great strength.</p>
<p>Those familiar with Greek mythology may have heard of the son of Zeus named Hercules known for his extraordinary strength. Our word of the day is often used to describe a task that requires such extraordinary strength, for example: I wasn’t prepared for how heavy Martha’s harp was. After trying to lift it, I soon discovered what a herculean task it was.</p>

<p>The patient didn’t seem to pick up the illness from any outside sources. So we surmised that an endogenous virus was the cause.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Atrophy]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Atrophy is a noun that refers to a wasting away.&nbsp;It can also serve as a verb that means ‘to waste away.’</p>
<p>The literal translation of our word of the day, from the Greeks is ‘lack of nourishment.’ But in more recent years, atrophy often takes on a more metaphorical meaning that has nothing to do with actual food. A person’s muscles can atrophy if they haven’t been used for a while and the same can happen to job skills that have been dormant.</p>
<p>As a kid I spoke fluent Italian. But it’s been so long since I’ve spoken any of the language that my Italian has atrophied a great deal.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Excursus is a noun that refers to a digression on a particular point.</p>
<p>From Latin, we get the word excurrere (EKS coo air ay) which refers to a digression. Our word of the day has undergone a number of changes, but its meaning remains the same. Don’t be put off by the formal sound of excursus. It’s a perfect word to use when talking about something written or expressed by a formal lecturer or writer.</p>
<p>Professor Mitchel’s history lecture was lovely except for the excursus about president Cleveland’s policies. That kind of lengthy digression on politics can often be a distraction.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Devolve is a verb that means to transfer or be passed on to another.</p>
<p>Our word of the day is often thought of as the opposite of the word evolve, and it is true that, like evolve, its origin is in the Latin word volvere (VOL vair ay) meaning ‘rolling.’ The addition of the prefix D-E, meaning ‘down’ gets us a word that means ‘rolling down.’ So devolve may mean ‘to degenerate through change or evolution.’ And it also refers to a right or responsibility that ‘rolls down’ from one person to the next. For example: Handling the Johnson account has devolved from my boss to me. I am now accountable for whatever happens in this case.</p>

<p>Our word of the day shares its roots with a planet and a Roman god. Mercury was Rome’s equivalent to the Greek god Hermes, and was known for being eloquent and ingenious. When mercurial entered the English language in the 14th century, the word was used to describe someone possessing these qualities. In time its meaning shifted to ‘unpredictable’ and ‘changeable’ in reference to the chemical used in thermometers, known for its quick changes as it rises and falls to reflect the temperature.</p>
<p>I was hoping we could hire a basketball coach who was a little more predictable and stable than our previous one. Coach Derringer’s mercurial nature was a real detriment to the team.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Solecism]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Solecism is a noun that means a blunder in speech.</p>
<p>The city of soloi was known for the bad grammar of its inhabitants known as solikos (SO loy kos). This gave birth to the word soloikismos (solo KIZZ moss) meaning, ‘an ungrammatical combination of words,’ which later became the basis for our word of the day. In more recent years, solecism has also come to refer to a social blunder as well as a verbal blunder.</p>
<p>Being the press secretary for a politician who commits many solecisms can be a thankless job. It usually means making lots of apologies for a wide range of blunders.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Yeasayer]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Yeasayer is a noun that means someone with a positive attitude.</p>
<p>You may have heard of the word naysayer, a noun referring to a person constantly denying or opposing things. Conversely, a yeasayer may refer to an upbeat, positive person known for saying ‘yes’ to things. Its less flattering meaning is a person always agreeing with or being submissive to other people, as in: It makes sense that Dennis would hire a yeasayer like Chuck as his assistant. There is nothing he loves more than having someone cater to all his wishes.</p>

<p>Our word of the day is a combination of the words ‘fuss,’ meaning ‘to show unnecessary concern’ and ‘budget,’ which refers to ‘an estimate of income and expenditures needed for a period of time.’ Together they create a word for somebody who worries needlessly about minor things — like a budget.</p>
<p>My grandpa can be a fussbudget at times. When I took him to lunch he spent the whole time fretting about how much cheaper the meal would have been if we had eaten it at his favorite diner in Miami.</p>

<p>The exact origin of our word of the day is something of a mystery, but some believe it may have been derived from the German word Mondkalb (MOON kype) which means a ‘fleshy mess.’ It was also believed that a mooncalf was deformed because of the influence of the moon. Regardless of its origin, the word came to mean an idiotic person, a meaning it continues to hold on to today.</p>
<p>Bridget may be smart, but she has moments where she can really be a mooncalf. The other day, for example, she asked me what night Monday night football was on.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Stolid is an adjective that means not easily moved.</p>
<p>Don’t be misled by out word of the day’s origin. It comes from the Latin stolidus (STOW lee doos) which means stupid. But a stolid person isn’t necessarily lacking in intelligence. Instead it referred to people who appear stupid because they say nothing. More recently the word has shed any connection to stupidly and is more likely to be used as a synonym of ‘unemotional’ or ‘stoic.’</p>
<p>Kevin’s demeanor remained stolid throughout the movie. I got the impression that he wasn’t moved by it at all.</p>

<p>Our word of the day combines two common English words ‘copper’ and ‘bottomed.’ In a literal sense it simply refers to something that is coated with copper — a very firm metal — on the bottom. But in a more metaphorical sense it refers to something that is solid like Copper and that comes with a guarantee.</p>
<p>I was told I had just purchased a copper-bottomed stock. As guaranteed, the stock shot up shortly after my buying it.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Evince is a verb that means to display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day comes from the Latin word vincere (VEEN chair ay) which means ‘conquer’ or ‘win.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you get carried away, keep in mind that the victories evince indicates take place not on a battlefield, but in the realm of a conversation or perhaps a legal trial. A person may ‘win’ a dispute when information is evinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When those cookies went missing, we weren’t sure who the culprit was. But the smell of chocolate chip on our little puppy’s breath evinced his guilt.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Fulgurant is an adjective that means flashing like lighting.</p>
<p>The Latin fulgur (FOOL goor) &nbsp;means ‘lightning.’ Our word of the day is usually used metaphorically to refer to a powerful brilliant flash — but not necessarily to refer to actual lightning.</p>
<p>The coach’s words struck me with fulgurant force. Those five words — ‘you’re cut from the team’ — didn’t take long to say, but their powerful impact wounded me deeply.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Osmotic]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Osmotic is an adjective that means having the properties of osmosis (a gradual assimilation of knowledge).</p>
<p>The Greek word Omos (OSE mose) means ‘thrusting’ or ‘pushing.’ You could say that when something osmotic is taking place, it is being thrust or pushed in some sense or other. When the word is used in a medical sense, it refers to something being pushed through a membrane. But used in an everyday context, an osmotic process may simply be something effortlessly or unconsciously assimilated, for example: Cheryl never took a music lesson. But there is something osmotic about the way she learned to play the violin as a result of growing up in a musical family.</p>

<p>Our word of the day is derived from the Latin word frons (fronce) which means ‘brow’ or ‘forehead’ combined with the prefix E-F, meaning ‘without.’ If this seems like an unlikely origin of a word for insolent behavior, keep in mind that the Romans thought of the brow as the seat of a person’s modesty much in the same we think of the heart as the seat of a person’s love life. So effrons (EE Fronce) meant ‘without shame.’</p>

<p>A combination of the English words ‘cut’ and ‘purse,’ our word of the day has been around since the 14th century. Its origin refers to the practice of stealing by cutting purses suspended from a waistband. But the term may be used to describe any pickpocket — regardless of their method of thievery.</p>
<p>I was victimized by a cutpurse at the fair last summer. Prior to that I had always assumed by wallet was safe in public.</p>

Its origin refers to the practice of stealing by cutting purses suspended from a waistband. But the term may be used to describe any pickpocket — regardless of their method of thievery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was victimized by a cutpurse at the fair last summer. Prior to that I had always assumed by wallet was safe in public.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>In addition to providing the origin of our word of the day, Latin word vigilare&nbsp;(vij uh ARE ay) meaning ‘to keep watch’ and ‘to stay awake’ has given us vigil, vigilant and vigilante.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Literatim is an adjective that means letter for letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literatim comes directly from Latin. Originally meaning ‘literature,’ its meaning has shifted a little over the years and now means ‘word for word,’ as in: Our English teacher demanded that we recite the introduction to Romeo and Juliet literatim. Even the tiniest deviation from the text would not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Widdershins is an adverb that means in a contrary direction.</p>
<p>Our word of the day is of German origin. It evolved from the word widersinnen (VEE der sin en) which means ‘against the way.’ In this case, the ‘way’ is clockwise, so widdershins first meant ‘counterclockwise.’ As it evolved through 16th century Scottish and eventually English, its meaning broadened a little into: ‘in a contrary direction.’</p>
<p>Harry has always been a contrarian. He seems to go through his daily life widdershins.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Thaumaturge is a noun that refers to a worker of miracles or a magician.</p>
<p>The Greek word thaumatourgos (THOU mah too gose) refers to a ‘conjuror or worker of wonders.’ The word’s meaning has remained more or less the same, but today we’re less likely to believe in the idea of someone working miracles. Still our word of the day is always handy when a miracle worker does emerge.</p>
<p>The medication took away my swollen feet immediately. It seemed to me that the doctor was something of a thaumaturge.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Alameda]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Alameda is a noun that refers to a public walkway shaped with trees.</p>
<p>Our word of the day comes directly from Spanish, where it referred to a poplar grove. It entered English in the late 18th century with basically the same meaning. It’s also a common baby name as well as a name of a city in north central California.</p>
<p>The alameda looks lovely this time of year. It’s wonderful to stroll along those trees just as they beginning to bloom.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Piquant is an adjective that means having a pleasantly sharp or spicy taste.</p>
<p>Piquant is a direct loan from our French friends. The word piquer (PEE kay) means ‘stinging or prickling.’ When the word shifted into English, its meaning shifted along with it. Now piquant had come to mean ‘pleasantly stinging.’ For context, something like mustard might be described as piquant, but not, say cornbread.</p>
<p>I usually prefer foods with a sweet as opposed to a piquant taste. But I enjoyed the meal just the same.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[Wayfaring is an adjective that means (of a person) traveling on foot.

Derived from the Old English words ‘way’ and ‘fare’ wayfaring has been around since the 14th century. It has a literary sound to it, but don’t be intimidated. It sounds right at home when used in a historical context.

In Medieval times, wayfaring peoples often visited villages across the river. For many of them, walking was their only option.

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I like the statue, it just doesn’t resemble the General as it was intended to. It’s lovely, but as an effigy, it has failed.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Effigy is a noun that refers to a sculpture or a model of a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day began with the Latin effingere (EFF in jare ay) meaning ‘to shape.’ In time effigy came to refer something being shaped, namely a sculpture designed to resemble something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I like the statue, it just doesn’t resemble the General as it was intended to. It’s lovely, but as an effigy, it has failed.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Harlequin]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Harlequin is an adjective that means of varied colors.</p>
<p>Based on an obsolete French word, harlequin got its name from the leader of a legendary troop of demon horsemen. Soon it became a name used for a character in traditional pantomime. A harlequin was usually masked and dressed in a diamond-patterned costume. Its flamboyant, colorful costume gave birth to the word harlequin as an adjective that means ‘in varied colors.’</p>
<p>My daughter loves to decorate things wildly and flamboyant. So when I tasked her with painting the doghouse, she came up with a lovely, harlequin scheme.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Apotheosis is a noun that means the highest point of development.</p>
<p>Our word of the day comes indirectly from the Ancient Greeks who had the interesting habit of ‘granting’ someone in your bloodline god status. Apparently this was so common, there was a word for it. That word is our word of the day, apotheosis and its literal translation was “making into a god.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word’s meaning has evolved over time into its present meaning. But it’s easy to see how “making into a god” could be the basis of “the highest point of development.”</p>
<p>Max’s career peaked in the late eighties. I feel he reached his apotheosis with his seventh album.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day comes indirectly from the Ancient Greeks who had the interesting habit of ‘granting’ someone in your bloodline god status. Apparently this was so common, there was a word for it. That word is our word of the day, apotheosis and its literal translation was “making into a god.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word’s meaning has evolved over time into its present meaning. But it’s easy to see how “making into a god” could be the basis of “the highest point of development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max’s career peaked in the late eighties. I feel he reached his apotheosis with his seventh album.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Confluence is a noun that means an act or process of merging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original meaning of confluence stems referred to a joining of rivers. With that in mind, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the word came from a Latin word confluere (co flew AIR ay) meaning ‘flow together.’ This is helpful to know whether using confluence in the old sense or in a sense such as: the conference was thrilling to attend. I’d never before heard such a brilliant confluence of ideas.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Innumerate is an adjective that means without basic mathematics skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Latin word numero (NEW mare oh) means number. By adding the prefix I-N, we get a word that means ‘not numerate.’ The best way to think of innumerate is as the math equivalent of illiterate. A person who is illiterate cannot read. A person who doesn’t have basic math skills is innumerate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was two, I found a dollar and thought I could buy a car. I suppose that was just a matter of being an innumerate child.</p>

<p>Panglass was a character in an 18th century novel by Voltaire called Candide. The character was known for remaining upbeat and optimistic even when things were going catastrophically wrong. It’s important not to use the word to describe an ordinary optimist, but someone whose optimism has reached foolish levels.</p>

<p>19th century English author Lewis Carrol is best known for the book Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, but he’s also widely been credited with adding to the vernacular by combining common words in a humorous way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the sequel to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland called Through the Looking Glass, he created the word ‘galumph’ by apparently combining Gallup and triumph. The result is our word of the day and although its meaning has shifted a little over the years to mean ‘to move in clumsily,’ it’s still almost never used as flattery.</p>
<p>I can hear Jimmy galumph into the office all the way from my cubicle. That kind of clumsiness is hard to keep quiet.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Raconteur is a noun that refers to a skilled storyteller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raconteur comes directly from the French word raconter (RACK on tay) meaning ‘relate.’ But don’t let the word’s simple origin trick you. A raconteur isn’t just someone who relates a story. They do so in an engaging, entertaining way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people doubted the veracity of Eddie’s wild stories, but personally, I found him such an extraordinary raconteur that I didn’t care whether his tales were true or not.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Enigmatic is an adjective that means mysterious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enigma comes to us directly from Greece, where it means ‘riddle.’ Comic book fans may recall a character named Ed Nygma, the alter ego of the Batman villain known as The Riddler. Not everyone called enigmatic has such a direct connection to riddles, but the word generally refers to those who are — like a riddle — difficult to figure out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having Eric as a boss can be a challenge. It’s hard to figure out the needs of someone so enigmatic.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Pellucid is an adjective that means clear or easily understood.</p>
<p>The Latin word lucere (LOO chair ay) means shine. Combined with per, for ‘through,’ we get shine through, meaning clear. Our word of the day may be used to describe something like water that is clear in a literal sense, or something like an idea or a passage of writing that is clear in a figurative sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film critic’s writing was awfully clever, but I couldn’t understand what he was actually trying to say about the movie. I would have preferred he express himself with more pellucid prose.</p>

<p>The Latin word ardere (ARE dare ay) means ‘to burn.’ It wasn’t far from there to get to a word that referred to a ‘burning passion.’</p>
<p>Working at the car wash for me, was just another job. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn’t say I had an ardor to clean hub caps.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Cloister is a verb that means to seclude or hide.</p>
<p>The Latin word claudere (klow ooh DARE ay) means ‘shut’ or ‘lock’ as in something you’d do to a door. From there, the word cloister was born, originally meaning a place of ‘religious seclusion,’ then, more specifically to a monastery or convent. It may also be used metaphorically to mean ‘shut off’ as if in a monastery or convent.</p>
<p>Jane can be something of an introvert. She has a tendency to cloister herself away for days.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Elide]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Latin word elido (el EE doe) means ‘to dash to pieces.’ The word elide first came to mean ‘omit’ in reference to a sound or syllable being omitted from a word. As time went be, the word took on another meaning. Omitting a sound or syllable often meant joining other sounds. For example, if we take ‘I will’ and omit the W and I sound, we join I and LL together to get ‘I’ll.’ To this day, elide can either mean ‘omit,’ in reference to a sound or syllable or ‘merge.’ But when it means ‘merge,’ it may refer to anything, for example: I was hoping my teacher would elide both classes. It would be nice to spend some time from the kids in room 23.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Bevy is a noun that refers to a large gathering of people or things of a particular kind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise origin of bevy is unknown, but it came to refer to a group of birds — especially quail — just as a ‘pack’ refers to a group of wolves. It may also refer to a group of people, for example: I was stunned by the bevy of movie stars I saw at the party that night. I’d never seen such a breathtaking collection of celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Aplomb is a noun that means self-confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aplomb comes from French, where it means, ‘according to a plumb line.’ A plumb line refers to a line dipped into water to determine the water level. It is steady and solid — just like a person with aplomb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diana’s unwavering aplomb was a great source of comfort for us. Because she didn’t lack confidence, neither did we.</p>

<p>Vilis (VY lis) is the Latin word for worthless. When combined with pendo (PEN doe), the Latin word for ‘considered,’ we get a word that means ‘considered or treated as if it has no worth.’&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don’t vilipend my friend for the mistakes he has made. In spite of his sloppy work, he is a valuable employee.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Truepenny]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Truepenny is a noun that refers to an honest person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truepenny is a portmanteau word that combines ‘true’ and ‘penny’ to give us a word for something genuine. A true penny, of course, refers to a coin that is exactly as it appears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had my doubts about Erica’s agent when we first met. But after dealing with her for many years, I can see her for the true penny she is.</p>

<p>Jeremy Diddler was a character from an early 19th century play called Raising the Wind. From that we get the word diddle, which means to swindle. The significance of TARA added to the word is not clear, but we do know that a taradiddle is less lethal than a diddle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Old French, the word aveugle (AH vug) meant ‘to blind.’ Our word of the day has a broader meaning than ‘to blind,’ but it must be remembered that to persuade someone through deception or flattery is to blind them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the feeling the salesman was trying to inveigle me into a higher price. Every time I asked about the car’s features, he would mention how much he admired my haircut.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Compunction is a noun that means guilt or remorse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Latin word pungere (POON Jay ray) means ‘to prick.’ This was combined with C-O-M, a suffix that implies excessive force. That gave us compungere (com poon JAY ray) which meant ‘to prick sharply.’ It may help to think of compunction as a sharp prick or stab at one’s conscience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Terry was tempted to use the handicapped parking sticker he found in the parking lot, but his conscience wouldn’t let him. As he walked into the store, it occurred to him that compunction has a way of limiting his parking options.</p>

Ariose comes from the same root, the Latin word aer (EYE ur) meaning ‘air.’ Describing something as ariose can be a supreme compliment, for example: It always surprised me that Michelle never pursued a career in music. With her ariose voice, she would have been a big success.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Minerva is a noun that means a woman of great wisdom.</p>
<p>Fans of Roman mythology may recall Minerva as the Goddess of wisdom. So referring to somebody — even a mere mortal — as a Minerva is another way of identifying her a source of great wisdom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To most people, my Grandmother was just an ordinary lady. But after all the brilliant advice I’d gotten from her I came to recognize her as a Minerva.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Moonstruck is an adjective that means dreamily romantic or bemused by love.</p>
<p>Our word of the day combines the familiar word ‘moon’ with the past participle of strike, to give us a way to describe someone who’s been metaphorically ‘struck’ or affected by the moon. Keep in mind that in the late 17th &nbsp;century, when moonstruck came to life, it was common for people to believe the moon had special powers to affect our behavior. Today, we simply think of moonstruck as a metaphor for being high on love.</p>
<p>Having a crush on his classmate has put Kevin in a strange mood. I’ve never seen him this moonstruck before.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Simon-Pure]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Simon-pure is a noun that means a completely authentic person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our word of the day comes from 18th century satirical play called Bold Stroke for a Wife. The name Simon-pure came to mean ‘authentic’ partly because the character is impersonated by someone else for most of the play and is only revealed to be ‘authentic’ when when the real Simon-pure identifies himself. Also the character is a Quaker preacher who is ‘authentic’ in the sense of being ‘honest.’</p>
<p>Today the word is often used in a sarcastic sense. For example: Desmond comes across like such a Simon-Pure, but I think it’s all a facade. Deep down, he’s just as devious as anyone else.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Gourmand is a noun that means a person who loves to eat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our word of the day comes directly from Old French where it meant ‘wine taster.’ More recently, the word’s appetite has expanded to include food. And in case you’re wondering, ‘gourmand’ has the same origin as ‘gourmet.’ &nbsp;— as in ‘a gourmet chef.’ They both mean ‘a connoisseur of good food,’ but gourmand is more likely to refer to somebody who enjoys eating that food — not necessarily cooking it.</p>
<p>Over the years, being a gourmand has expanded my cultural horizons a great deal. But unfortunately all that savoring of French and Italian cuisine has also expanded my waistline.</p>

<p>Our word of the day combines the Greek prefix ‘holo’ meaning whole and the Latin phrasis (pee ROCK sees) meaning ‘expression.’ Together they mean a single word that conveys an entire sentence. Howdy, a single word that means ‘how do you do.’ Is an example of a holophrase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I was confused when Corey raced into the room and shouted, ‘pizza!’ But after knowing him for a while, I’ve realized this was just a holophrase for ‘I must have some pizza <em>now</em>.’ By the way, a holophrase is sometimes known as a holophrasis.</p>

<p>The Latin word atavus (AH tah voos) means forefather and atavus could be considered the forefather of our word of the day. When we describe something as atavistic, we’re usually not referring to a specific forefather or ancestor, but more generally, to something ancient.&nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Labile is an adjective that means easily altered or unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labile originates from the Latin word labi (LAH bee) which means ‘fall’ or ‘slip.’ This is why in chemistry our word of the day is often used to mean ‘easily broken down’ or ‘displaced.’ In everyday use, labile may refer to a person’s health or their emotions, as in: It’s been a rough year for Randal. After all the ups and downs he’s experienced, his state of mind has become quite labile.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Accretion a noun that means the process of gradual growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Latin word for grow is accidere (ah CHEE dare ay), which, over time gradually grew into our word of the day. Accretion is often used to describe a natural process of growth that you may see in a lawn or a body of water. But it may also be used to describe something like a city’s growth. For example: the accretion of the downtown area has been interesting to watch over the years. In all my years as a city planner I’ve never seen such broad expansion.</p>

<p>The Latin word for poise or balance is libramen (lee BRAHM en) where our word of the day comes from. It may be used in a scientific sense to refer, for example, to molecule holding in place by oscillating. Or it may be used in a more every day sense to simply mean ‘balance.’&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Latin word for beard is barba (BAR buh) which may seem like an odd origin for a word that means ‘causing annoyance or irritation,’ until you consider the journey that our word of the day has taken over the years. Rebarbative is derived from the phrase ‘standing beard to beard,’ which means ‘opposing’ or ‘standing against.’ So you may think of rebarbative behavior as behavior that annoys or irritates someone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t believe our boss allowed Chuck to get away with such rebarbative behavior. Taking a nap during a staff meeting is the kind of oppositional act that can a person fired at this firm.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ophidian is an adjective that means pertaining to or having the characteristics of a snake.</p>
<p>The Greek word for ‘snake’ is Ophia (OH fee uh) a word that, over the centuries has morphed into our word of the day. Ophidian may be used literally to refer to an actual snake or figuratively to describe someone whose demeanor may remind you of those creepy little reptiles, for example: On the surface, Brad seems like a perfectly upright, honest salesman. But when you get to know him and his sales tactics, his true ophidian nature is revealed.&nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Ophidian is an adjective that means pertaining to or having the characteristics of a snake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek word for ‘snake’ is Ophia (OH fee uh) a word that, over the centuries has morphed into our word of the day. Ophidian may be used literally to refer to an actual snake or figuratively to describe someone whose demeanor may remind you of those creepy little reptiles, for example: On the surface, Brad seems like a perfectly upright, honest salesman. But when you get to know him and his sales tactics, his true ophidian nature is revealed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Acquisitive is an adjective that means excessively interested in acquiring money or material things.</p>
<p>In Latin, acquiro (ah KWEE roe) means ‘to get’ or ‘obtain.’ The word’s distant relative acquisitive basically carries the same meaning, ‘excessively interested in getting or obtaining things.’ The word is pretty much always used in a judgmental or pejorative sense. You could think of it as a synonym of greedy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Doris was surrounded by opulent artifacts at the museum all day, she was never tempted to steal anything. Thankfully, she wasn’t a very acquisitive person.</p>

<p>Our word of the day is a combination of two fairly common English words ‘in’ and ‘dwell.’ It may be best to think of it as a verb that basically means to ‘dwell in’ someone’s mind. For example: Erica’s sentimental goodbye may indwell my head forever. I don’t think I’ll ever forget those lovely words.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Indwell is a verb that means to be permanently present in someone&apos;s mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day is a combination of two fairly common English words ‘in’ and ‘dwell.’ It may be best to think of it as a verb that basically means to ‘dwell in’ someone’s mind. For example: Erica’s sentimental goodbye may indwell my head forever. I don’t think I’ll ever forget those lovely words.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Avulsion is a noun that means the act of pulling or tearing away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A combination of the Latin words for ‘from’ and ‘pluck’ give us avallere (ah val AIR ay). In time, this morphed into avulsion, meaning to pull or tear away. The word may be used literally or figuratively, as in: Chuck’s avulsion from his family was a painful thing to see. It’s never pleasant to watch someone get separated from loved ones.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Puffery is a noun that means false or exaggerated praise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word puff, as in something you’d do into a balloon to blow it up, has its origin in Middle English. Like many words, it began as an effort to imitate the sound made while performing the act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our word of the day is more likely to be used metaphorically. You may think of puffery as something you do to inflate someone’s ego, just as puffing would inflate a balloon.</p>
<p>Whenever we need a favor from the mayor, a little puffery over the phone doesn’t hurt. Having his ego flattered always seems to put him in a generous mood.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mordant is an adjective that means having a sharp or critical manner.</p>
<p>You may have heard the word mordacious used to describe a dog inclined to bite. Our word of the day is also derived from the word bite. Both words come from the Latin word Mordere (MORE dair ay) which means — you guessed it — bite. But our word of the day is more likely to be used figuratively, as in: Shelly’s mordant wit doesn’t always go over so well with her teachers. They don’t find her biting remarks to be helpful in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Waggish comes to us from Old English.

In more recent years we can refer to waggish behavior in less serious terms, for example: At first, I panicked when I saw what appeared to be a snake on my office chair.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Fabulist is a noun that means a person who invents elaborate and dishonest stories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabulist has its roots in the word fable, which comes to us from the Latin fabula (FAB oo la). It may refer either to a person who tells fables or a person who lies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angie’s tales of growing up in rural Montana are a bit exaggerated. But she’s such an imaginative fabulist that I don’t care whether her stories are true or not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Abience is a noun that means a strong urge to avoid something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our word of the day comes from the Latin word abeo (AH bay oh) which means ‘to go away.’ Its descendent abience is commonly used in a psychological context, for example: the patient’s abience of sporting events suggests he’s had some bad experiences with them in the past. It is common for people to avoid activities that remind them of childhood pain.</p>

<p>You may know from other words of Greek origin like philosophy and philomath that philocaly’s first five letters — PHILO — indicate a love of something. In this case it’s a love of beauty as ‘caly’ comes from the Greek word kallos (KAHL os) meaning ‘beauty.’</p>

<p>Our word of the day takes root in the Latin word remunera (ray MOON ay ruh) which means reward. Remuneration can mean the same as ‘payment,’ but its a broader word, that can refer to something other than money, for example: It felt great to take a dip in Aunt Shelly’s swimming pool after mowing her lawn. It was wonderful remuneration for a few hours of hard work.&nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Remuneration is a noun that means payment for a service or work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day takes root in the Latin word remunera (ray MOON ay ruh) which means reward. Remuneration can mean the same as ‘payment,’ but its a broader word, that can refer to something other than money, for example: It felt great to take a dip in Aunt Shelly’s swimming pool after mowing her lawn. It was wonderful remuneration for a few hours of hard work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day comes from Latin. The word parare (puh RAH ray) means ‘to ward off or defend.’ It’s a good word to use to describe someone in a fight — whether the fight is physical or verbal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to slip under Gerry’s guard with my sword. But he was fast enough to parry my blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, parry is spelled P-A-R-R-Y.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hagridden is an adjective that means tormented by anxiety or stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Old Norse, the word hexe (HECKS uh) means witch. It’s also a distant cousin of the word ‘hag.’ Combine this with ridden and you get an adjective — hagridden — that means tormented by stress or anxiety, as if haunted by a witch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doris was hagridden by all the paperwork needed to make the new sale. She felt like a trail of paper was haunting her every step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hagridden is spelled H-A-G-R-I-D-D-E-N.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Paramnesia is a noun that means a confusion of fact and fantasy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paramnesia is a combination of a Greek word you’re probably already familiar with — Amnesia, meaning ‘loss of memory’ and the prefix ‘para’ which can mean a number of things depending on its context. In this case it means ‘against’ as in ‘against reality.’ Think of the word paranormal as a paramnesia’s second cousin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that weird dream I had last night, I woke up with a weird case of paramnesia. I wasn’t sure if I had actually been chased by a dragon the night before or if that was part of my dream.</p>
<p>Paramnesia is spelled P-A-R-A-M-N-E-S-I-A.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>"Alexa, open Volley FM"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Today’s word of the day is mondegreen. It’s spelled M-O-N-D-E-G-R-E-E-N. &nbsp;Mondegreen is a noun that means a misheard or misunderstood phrase.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The word mondegreen was born with a 17th century poem called ‘The Bonnie Earl o’ Moray.’</p>
<p>It contains two lines that read:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>They have slain the Earl o’ Moray</p>
<p>And Lady Mondegreen.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When the last line was mistakenly heard as ‘And laid him on the green’ our word of the day came to life. Today, a ‘mondegreen refers to any phrase or song lyric that is mistaken for something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My favorite mondegreen is contained in the song Purple Haze. For years, I thought Jimi Hendrix was saying ‘Excuse me while I kiss this guy,’ when he was really saying ‘excuse me while I kiss the sky.’&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>.Mondegreen is spelled M-O-N-D-E-G-R-E-E-N.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s word of the day is treacle. It’s spelled T-R-E-A-C-L-E. Treacle is a noun that means sentimentality or flattery.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Latin word Theriaca (TER ee ah ca) referred to an antidote or cure, and as time went on, the word’s meaning shifted to refer to a thick, sugary liquid. When used to describe a work of art, it’s pretty much never meant as a compliment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Falling in love was the worst thing that could happen to our band’s songwriter. Now everything he writes is pure treacle.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is funambulism, F-U-N-A-M-B-U-L-I-S-M. Funambulism is a noun that means tightrope walking or a display of mental agility.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Tightrope walking was a highly popular spectacle in ancient Rome. So it's no surprise that the language generally spoken by the Romans, Latin, would give us the word for this act of daring. Funis (FOO nis) is Latin for rope, and ambulare (am byoo LAHR ay) means walk.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Funambulism may literally refer to the act of tightrope walking or it may be metaphorically used to indicate a feat of mental gymnastics that could be just as tricky, such as: When George was caught sleeping in history class, I wanted to see him talk his way out of a trip to detention. Sure enough he dazzled us all with an act of funambulism by convincing Mrs. Sharpe that he'd been up all night caring for his sick grandmother.</p>
<p><br></p>

			<title><![CDATA[Supererogation - #529]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is supererogation. It's spelled S-U-P-E-R-E-R-O-G-A-T-I-O-N. Supererogation is a noun that means the act of performing more than is required.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Latin prefix 'super' means 'over and above,' but the second section of our word of the day is a little more complicated. Erogare (air oh GAHR ay) also Latin, originally meant 'to expand public funds after asking the consent of the people.'&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later the word took on on a religious meaning, and came to be referred to as the doing of good deeds beyond what is needed for salvation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>More recently, supererogation's meaning has expanded further still, and is now used to refer to any act performed beyond obligation. Connie has been an outstanding employee. Her staying late last night was an act of supererogation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once again, supererogation is spelled S-U-P-E-R-E-R-O-G-A-T-I-O-N.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is numinous, N-U-M-I-N-O-U-S. Numinous is an adjective that means supernatural or mysterious.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Latin word numen (NOO men) for 'divine will' got things started, but the word numinous picked up steam in the seventeenth century, broadening to mean anything mysterious. Something doesn't have to actually come from the heavens above to be described as numinous, it only has to seem as though it had.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My daughter's skill at painting is nothing short of numinous. It looks as if her paintbrush was guided by forces from above.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is ululate. It's spelled U-L-U-L-A-T-E. Ululate is a verb that means to howl or wail.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It's very likely that the sound of wailing birds inspired the origin of the Latin word ululare (oo loo LAHR ay) which, of course, means, to wail. Ululate can also apply to humans, but it's best to use it when describing humans making an animal-like wail.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I heard Maria's stunning singing voice emerge from the basement, I mistook her for an owl. That's how beautiful it sounds when she ululates.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is supercilious, S-U-P-E-R-C-I-L-I-O-U-S. Supercilious is an adjective that means behaving as if one thinks one is superior to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Super is often used as a word or prefix in a way that is admirable or positive. But supercilious reminds us that 'super' a prefix of Ancient Greek descent that simply means 'above,' can be negative or positive depending on its context.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In this case it combines with the Latin word for eyebrow in a way that gives us supercilious, which means arrogant. If eyebrow seems like a strange word to get us there, keep in mind the phrase 'high brow,' which is often used as a synonym of conceited or haughty.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We all enjoyed Ron's donation's to our charity. But there's no denying that he can get a little supercilious from time to time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The spelling of supercilious is S-U-P-E-R-C-I-L-I-O-US.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Carrefour - #516]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is carrefour, C-A-R-R-E-F-O-U-R. Carrefour is a noun that refers to a crossroads or a plaza.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The key to grasping carrefour's meaning and proper use is in the word 'four.' But it's not what you think. The Latin word for four is quattuor. (KWAT to wahr), which has, over the years evolved into the C-A-R-R-E of carrefour.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An easy way to remember this is to recall that a quarter of something is one fourth. Think a quarter as a fourth of a dollar or an American football game as having four quarters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The second half of carrefour, F-O-U-R, strangely enough, has nothing to do with the number four. Is is derived from furkus (FOOR koos) the Latin word for fork. So a carrefour is a crossroads, or a meeting of four roads.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That carrfour across town can be pretty dangerous. Having cars racing toward each other from four different directions is just courting an accident.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is aggrandize, A-G-G-R-A-N-D-I-Z-E. Aggrandize &nbsp;is a verb that means to enlarge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Recognizing the word 'grand' in aggrandize is the key to understanding its meaning. coming from the French word agrandir (ah grahn DEER) meaning 'to enlarge' it simply means to make something bigger.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But aggrandize isn't a word to throw around lightly. It should be used to describe giant, important things. You wouldn't ask the cashier to aggrandize your serving of french fries, but you might say: The result of this war is that it will aggrandize our nation on the world's stage. We will become an unstoppable global power.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The spelling of aggrandize is A-G-G-R-A-N-D-I-Z-E.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is volitant. It’s spelled V-O-L-I-T-A-N-T. Volitant is an adjective that means having the power of flight.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Believe it or not, a word that describes a creature’s ability to fly is related to the word volatile. They both come from the Latin volito (VALL ee toe) meaning ‘to rush back and forth’ or ‘hurry.’</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>But a bird that is volitant is not necessarily in a bad mood. It simply has the ability to fly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Chasing down that chicken was a tough task. But it might have been even tougher had the bird been volitant.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Today’s word of the day is volitant. It’s spelled V-O-L-I-T-A-N-T. Volitant is an adjective that means having the power of flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, a word that describes a creature’s ability to fly is related to the word volatile. They both come from the Latin volito (VALL ee toe) meaning ‘to rush back and forth’ or ‘hurry.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a bird that is volitant is not necessarily in a bad mood. It simply has the ability to fly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing down that chicken was a tough task. But it might have been even tougher had the bird been volitant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volitant is spelled V-O-L-I-T-A-N-T.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is resplendent, R-E-S-P-L-E-N-D-E-N-T. Resplendent is an adjective that means shiny and colorful; pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Latin splendere (splen DARE ay) means to shine. It’s related to many words like splendid, splendor and, of course, our word of the day, resplendent. It means pleasing to the eye, but more specifically it refers to something that pleases the eye because of its bright, brilliant colors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>That bird’s multicolored plumage had me spellbound. I’d never anything more resplendent in my life.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once again, resplendent is spelled R-E-S-P-L-E-N-D-E-N-T.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is autoschediasm. It’s spelled A-U-T-O-S-C-H-E-D-I-A-S-M. Autoschediasm is a noun that means anything done with little forethought or preparation.</p>
<p>The Greek word for something done off hand schediasm (ske DIE asm) is where our word of the day came from. The Latins came around later and added the ‘auto,’ but the basic meaning has remained the same. The word ‘improvisation’ is a synonym, but an autoschediasm is not necessarily done by an an actor or professional performer. For example: When her cat slipped from the mantle, Barb quickly reached down and caught him before he hit the ground. This autoschediasm illustrates how fast Barb’s actions are.</p>
<p>Once again, the spelling of autoschediasm is A-U-T-O-S-C-H-E-D-I-A-S-M.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although aegis comes directly from Latin, its true origin is in Greek mythology. The word began life as a reference to the shield of Athena. From there, aegis came to refer to a form of protection from a respected mentor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the aegis of the coach, I was allowed to skip a few days of practice. Without the coach’s permission I might have gotten into serious trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>If you’re familiar with Shakespeare, you’ve heard many people referred to as a knave. You may have noticed that the word is never intended as a compliment. This word of Middle English descent is a synonym of such unflattering terms as ‘scoundrel’ or ‘rascal.’&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a junior high teacher, I’ve witnessed a great deal of knavery over the years. The worst involved a prank that left my clothes full of ink.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is pleonasm, P-L-E-O-N-A-S-M. Pleonasm is a noun that means the excessive use of words.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our word of the day began in Ancient Greece. The word pleonasmós (play on ESS moss) meant “I am superfluous.” Today pleonasm refers to a needlessly wordy use of words.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When my English teacher told me I shouldn’t waste time being verbose and excessive and redundant while writing passages that were much more wordy than necessary, he seemed to be providing exactly the kind of pleonasm he was warning me against using.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Pleonasm is spelled P-L-E-O-N-A-S-M.&nbsp;</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our word of the day began in Ancient Greece. The word pleonasmós (play on ESS moss) meant “I am superfluous.” Today pleonasm refers to a needlessly wordy use of words.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my English teacher told me I shouldn’t waste time being verbose and excessive and redundant while writing passages that were much more wordy than necessary, he seemed to be providing exactly the kind of pleonasm he was warning me against using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleonasm is spelled P-L-E-O-N-A-S-M.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Sibylline - #496]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is sibylline. It’s spelled S-I-B-Y-L-L-I-NE. Sibylline is an adjective that means mysterious.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>History buffs may recall a figure known as the Cumaean Sybil, a priestess who presided over the Appollonian oracle at a Greek colony. Her reputedly divine powers have been preserved in Greek and Roman Legend.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The priestesses’ name comes from the Greek Sybilla (SEE bee la) which means prophetess. But a contemporary figure doesn’t need telepathic powers to earn it. Simply being mysterious is enough. Nobody really understood Mindy. She was just this odd sibylline figure in a black cape and a purple wig.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once again, sibylline is spelled S-I-B-Y-L-L-I-N-E.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is adust, A-D-U-S-T. Adust is an adjective that means scorched or burned.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Adustus (AHH doos toos) is the Latin word for scorched. It has traditionally been used in a medical context, but may also be used to describe an item that has been burned. After the fire, our favorite shade tree was adust. It saddened me to see something so lovely reduced to a charred piece of wood.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is lucubration. It’s spelled L-U-C-U-B-R-A-T-I-O-N. Lucubration is a noun that means laborious or intensive study.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Latin word Lucubro (loo COO bro) means ‘to study by lamplight or candle light.’ Although our word of the day’s meaning has broadened since its original definition, the image of someone intently studying in the late night hours is a good one to help understand lucubration’s best usage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Riant is best used to refer to the latter, as in: In spite of her current problems, Shelly seemed pretty riant. It looked as though she was laughing through the pain.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Lenity - #488]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is lenity. It's spelled L-E-N-I-T-Y. Lenity is a noun that means the state of being mild or gentle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Latin word lenitas (lay NEE tas) means mild or gentle, and our word of the day hasn't drifted very far from its ancient origin. To behave with lenity is to be mild or gentle -- especially with someone who hasn't been mild or gentle with you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After years of enduring insulting behavior from his co-workers, Andy chose a noble path. He had enough lenity in his heart to not terminate those who had insulted him once he was promoted to supervisor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The spelling of lenity is L-E-N-I-T-Y.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Sisyphean - #487]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is sisyphean, S-I-S-Y-P-H-E-A-N. Sisyphean is an adjective that means endless.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The myth of Sisyphus is an ancient Greek tale of a King whose punishment for deceitful behavior was to be forced to roll an giant rock up a hill only to have the rock roll back down the hill, urging him to repeat the act over and over again for all eternity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When something is described as Sisyphean, that means it is both laborious and futile. For example: Emptying those dumpsters behind the school feels like a Sisyphean task. You empty them week after week, but they just fill up again.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sisyphean is spelled S-I-S-Y-P-H-E-A-N.</p>

<p>The Latin word eximius (ex EEM ee oos) means 'set apart' or 'select.' As you might guess, eximious is not a word to toss around casually.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is agog. It's spelled A-G-O-G. Agog is an adjective that means full of interest or excitement.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The origin of agog seems to be the French phrase en gogues (en GOG) which means in good humor. But agog's meaning has shifted a little over the years. A person may be agog -- meaning full of interest or excitement -- without necessarily being in a good mood.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For example: When our supervisor announced there were big changes ahead for the company, everybody was agog for days. We were relieved to learn the changes he had in mind involved replacing the office furniture.</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s word of the day is legerity, L-E-G-E-R-I-T-Y. Legerity is a noun that means alert quickness of mind and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Latin word Levis (LEV ees) means light, as in &apos;light on your feet.&apos; This is a good way to think of legerity. As a younger man, the prizefighter was praised for his legerity. But these days he just plods around the ring, waiting to get repeatedly jabbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, legerity is spelled L-E-G-E-R-I-T-Y.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's word of the day is crocodilian, C-R-O-C-O-D-I-L-I-A-N. Crocodilian is an adjective that means hypocritical or insincere.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you recognize the word crocodile in our word of the day, you can probably guess that crocodilian means 'related to or like a crocodile.' But a less common use of the word is as a synonym of hypocritical or insincere. Anyone who's seen a crocodile patiently hide in water to trap a prey can easily understand this use of crododilian.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Brett's crocodilian nature was revealed soon after he learned of Laura's fortune. Once the money was available, he abandoned any disguise of docility.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The exact origin of flack, meaning 'a press agent' or 'one who provides publicity,' is unknown. But the rumor mill suggests the it comes from a well-known movie publicist of the 1930s named Gene Flack. True or not, the story illustrates the kind of person who would engage in what would be called flackery. It may refer to show business or other things not taken very seriously.</p>

<p>My career as a professional wrestler never quite got off the ground. My problem is I never had the right flackery to put my name in the limelight.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Dulcet - #471]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is dulcet, D-U-L-C-E-T. Dulcet is an adjective that means pleasing to taste or hear.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our word of the day is a versatile one that may be used in a wide range of contexts. Dulcet comes from the Latin Dulcis (DOOL chees) that simply means sweet, pleasant or agreeable. Although it may refer to any of the five senses, the two most commonly cited are taste and sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After a hard day of work at the factory, Andy had an unusual way to unwind. He’d lay in his backyard and savor the dulcet tones of crickets chirping.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once again, the spelling of dulcet is D-U-L-C-E-T.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Latin verb quarere (KWA were ay)which means ‘to ask’ has given birth to many commonly used words. Among them, are inquire, inquiry, query and quest. The best way to understand perquisite’s use is &nbsp;to recall that the word perk is a shortened variation of it.</p>

<p>You may have noticed the word rail embedded in our word of the day. The two words do share a common ancestor in the Latin word ragere (rah GER ay). But when used to describe a conversation the two words differ a great deal in tone. Rail means to revile or scold in &nbsp;harsh or abusive language. Raillery, on the other hand, in a softer more playful word.&nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;Today’s word of the day is Aesopian. It’s spelled A-E-S-O-P-I-A-N. Aesopian is an adjective that means conveying an innocent meaning to an outsider but a hidden meaning to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aesop’s fables are well known for containing a hidden meaning or moral beneath their innocuous surface. An Aesopian statement contains a similarly hidden message.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Julie told me and the kids to make sure not to forget anything when we came home that afternoon, she was actually delivering an Aesopian message. She was signaling me to make sure I picked up the cake for Aurora’s surprise birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, Aesopian is spelled A-E-S-O-P-I-A-N.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Climacteric - #462]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is climacteric. It’s spelled C-L-I-M-A-C-T-E-R-I-C. Climacteric is a noun that means a major turning point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word klimakter (KLEE mack ter) comes from Ancient Greek. It’s literal translation is ‘rung on a ladder,’ which may be helpful if you think of that rung as the most important one on the ladder.</p>
<p>My first job interview didn’t seem like a big deal at the time. But looking back, I had reached a climacteric in my life.</p>
<p>Once again, climacteric is spelled C-L-I-M-A-C-T-E-R-I-C.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today’s word of the day is ruction, R-U-C-T-I-O-N. Ruction is a noun that means a disturbance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The precise origin of ruction is unclear. It seems to be a shortening of insurrection. But while insurrection is a more specific term that refers to something like a rebellion against an authority, ruction may be used to describe anything from a prison riot to the noise made by a pair of unruly toddlers.</p>
<p>The ruction outside my front door caught my attention immediately. I opened the door to find my cranky grandparents had been accidentally locked out.</p>
<p>Once again, ruction is spelled R-U-C-T-I-O-N.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[Today’s word of the day is marginalia, M-A-R-G-I-N-A-L-I-A. Marginalia is a noun that means nonessential items.

You probably recognize the word margin, a word that, when used figuratively, may refer to a line that separates inclusion and exclusion from a group. Think of marginalia as the place someone or something winds up after being marginalized.

President Arthur was a figure of enormous importance. That’s why it pains me to see historians relegate his contributions to marginalia.

Once again, marginalia is spelled M-A-R-G-I-N-A-L-I-A.

			<title><![CDATA[Pelf - #456]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s word of the day is pelf. It’s spelled P-E-L-F. Pelf is a noun that means money or riches.

Pelf is derived from the Anglo-French word pelfre (PEL free) which means ‘stolen money.’ The English word pilfer (‘to steal’) is also a descendent of pelfre. Pelf’s definition is simply ‘money’ but the word is usually used in a context that suggest the gains are ill-gotten. 

After years of selling bogus watches to tourists, James’ conscience caught up with him. He donated thousands of the pelf to charity. 

Once again, pelf is spelled P-E-L-F.

			<description><![CDATA[Today’s word of the day is perspicacious, P-E-R-S-P-I-C-A-C-I-O-U-S. Perspicacious is an adjective that means keen or of acute mental vision. 

The Latin word perspicere (PAIR spee care ay) got things started with a word that meant ‘to look through’ or ‘to see clearly.’ From here a number of English words were born, including periscope, a device used to help navigate a submarine. It may help to think of a perspicacious person as someone skilled at looking through the surface and seeing things clearly — as they would if gazing through a periscope.

At first, Henry seemed to be paying Jane a friendly visit. But Jane was perspicacious enough to know he was sniffing around for a favor.

Our word of the day’s journey begins with the Ancient Greek word homilos (HO me los) which meant crowd or assembly. This word later morphed into homily, ‘a short sermon.’ Anything related to a homily may be called homiletic. 

Sandy’s pep talk at the meeting got everybody fired up. Not only did she motivate us, but her homiletic language helped us understand the moral guidelines we needed to follow.

			<description><![CDATA[
Today’s word of the day is predial, P-R-E-D-I-A-L. Predial is an adjective that means related to land or its products.

Derived from the Latin word for estate, Praedium (PRAY dee um), predial is frequently used in a legal context, such as: The records show that Howard has paid millions in predial tax. Such a large estate can be quite expensive.

Today’s word of the day is predial, P-R-E-D-I-A-L. Predial is an adjective that means related to land or its products.

Derived from the Latin word for estate, Praedium (PRAY dee um), predial is frequently used in a legal context, such as: The records show that Howard has paid millions in predial tax. Such a large estate can be quite expensive. 

Once again, predial is spelled P-R-E-D-I-A-L.

			<title><![CDATA[Cassandra - #452]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s word of the day us Cassandra. It’s spelled C-A-S-S-A-N-D-R-A. Cassandra means one who predicts misfortune.

Understanding the origin of the word Cassandra, requires a quick lesson in Greek mythology. Cassandra was a character who, after rejecting the romantic advances of the god Apollo, was blessed and cursed with the ability to foretell the future, with the catch that her prophecies, although accurate, were never believed. 

In more recent years, the word is used to describe those who predict doom – regardless of whether they are believed. Peter is usually an upbeat, optimistic fellow, but his recent financial struggles have turned him into something of a Cassandra. Lately, he’s been predicting the collapse of Wall Street.

Cassandra, once again, is spelled C-A-S-S-A-N-D-R-A.

			<title><![CDATA[Harbinger - #451]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s word of the day is harbinger, H-A-R-B-I-N-G-E-R. Harbinger is a noun that means one that foreshadows what is about to come. 

In Medieval English the word harbinger referred to a person who went ahead of his fellow travelers to find lodging. The word’s meaning has shifted a little since then, but the image of someone moving ahead of the of the pack may still be helpful. 

When Julie quit her job at the drugstore out of frustration, she was a harbinger for the workplace. Within a year, nearly everybody else would leave.

Once again, harbinger is spelled H-A-R-B-I-N-G-E-R.

			<title><![CDATA[Unctuous - #450]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s word of the day is unctuous. It’s spelled U-N-C-T-U-O-U-S. Unctuous is an adjective that means insincerely smooth.

The Latin word for anoint, Unguere (oon GWAY ray) is where unctuous’s journey begins. But a better way to understand the word’s origin is to recall that things were often anointed with oily or greasy substances. 

As time went by, unctuous came to mean oily, and it later referred to people who behaved in a slick manner. Think of someone trying to win your favor with false flattery.

The salesman had an unctuous quality to him that made him good at his job. I wound up buying five hundred acres of Florida swampland.

The spelling of unctuous is U-N-C-T-U-O-U-S.

			<title><![CDATA[Tutelage - #449]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s word of the day is tutelage, T-U-T-E-L-A-G-E. Tutelage is a noun that means guiding influence.

The Latin word tueri (too AIR ee) means to guard. But as often happens to words of ancient origin, its meaning shifted over time, and words derived from tueri came to refer to a teacher or guiding influence. That’s how we get words like tutor and tuition. It’s also how being ‘under someone’s tutelage’ often refers to a teacher of some sort. 

After years under Miss Loenstein’s tutelage, I could finally master the basics of concert flute. I couldn’t imagine any other teacher being as helpful.

Once again, tutelage is T-U-T-E-L-A-G-E.

			<title><![CDATA[Bathetic - #448]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s word of the day is bathetic. It’s spelled B-A-T-H-E-T-I-C. Bathetic means trite or sentimental.

Loosely connected to the similar sounding pathetic, bathetic has its roots in Ancient Greek. Pathos comes from a Greek word meaning ‘evoking pity,’ while bathos originally meant ‘depth,’ which came to mean ‘excessively sentimental.’ A movie character that brings you to tears of sadness is pathetic. A movie character that aims for pathetic but instead brings you to tears of unintended laughter is bathetic. 

Marne was never a fan of cheesy romance novels. Those bathetic characters always evoked nothing from her but eye rolls and groans.

			<title><![CDATA[Deportment - #424]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[Today's word of the day is deportment. It's spelled D-E-P-O-R-T-M-E-N-T. Deportment is a noun that means behavior; the way one conducts oneself.

The French word for 'to carry away,' deporter (day por TAY) gives us the origin of deportment. It also gives us the origin of deport, meaning 'to remove from the country.' This is an example of how a word's origin can branch off to two very different words.

In the case of deportment, 'carry away' refers to the way a person carries themselves, as in your deportment throughout this ordeal has been admirable. You have carried yourself as a true gentlemen.
Once again, deportment is spelled D-E-P-O-R-T-M-E-N-T.

			<description><![CDATA[Today's word of the day is blithesome, B-L-I-T-H-E-S-O-M-E. Blithesome is an adjective that means cheerful and happy.

A combination of the Old English word blithe that simply means happy and the suffix 'some' that indicates 'a tendency toward' -- as in wholesome, awesome or bothersome -- gets us to blithesome, a word that, given its Old English origin, usually sounds best when used in an old world context.

The fair maiden remained blithesome all evening. But her mood soon shifted when she learned of her father's cruel fate.
Blithesome is spelled B-L-I-T-H-E-S-O-M-E.
