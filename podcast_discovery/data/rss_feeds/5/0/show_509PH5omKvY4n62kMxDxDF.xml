			<title><![CDATA[EP 7 : The One Where Your Pain and Trauma became your Default ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>üñïüèª‚ù§Ô∏èWe all have experienced pain, trauma, loss to varying degrees in our lives. Yet us humans feel so alone in this. AND can hang onto that as familiarity and safety even though this thought pattern, behaviour and life no longer serves us. I want to talk about how our ego loves to hang onto our past to protect us from the future. Can you let this go? Who would you be without your stories? What would that create space for? Let's discuss it shall we?!!!!</p>
<p>Love ya. xoxo&nbsp;</p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;üñïüèª‚ù§Ô∏èWe all have experienced pain, trauma, loss to varying degrees in our lives. Yet us humans feel so alone in this. AND can hang onto that as familiarity and safety even though this thought pattern, behaviour and life no longer serves us. I want to talk about how our ego loves to hang onto our past to protect us from the future. Can you let this go? Who would you be without your stories? What would that create space for? Let&apos;s discuss it shall we?!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love ya. xoxo&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[ EP 6 : The One With Sunniva Holt]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>üñïüèª‚ù§Ô∏è. It's time to get into MANIFESTATION and MONEY. These 2 subjects were confusing, taboo, and actually used to scare the fuck out of me. But from facing off with my own worth and value, I am becoming a master manifestor AND money loves me and I love money. In this episode of juicy delish, I have the absolute Queen of all things manifesting and money, <strong>Sunniva Holt</strong>, to give you a real insight into how you can change the game and manifest for yourself AND move from lack and scarcity in money to love and abundance, She knows her shit. So grab a pen and paper to take this in because the tips and insight she brings could be the thing that changes it all for you if you apply it. ARE YOU READY???&nbsp;</p>
