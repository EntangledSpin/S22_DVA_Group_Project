			<title><![CDATA[Scumbag Steve PATREON sneak peak and BONUS EPISODE (2 for 1)]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[My best friend in like Scumbag Steve joins us to talk about how many bongs his dad broke of his even tho he is 30 years old he still lives at home. That is a sneak preview of a patreon episode which usually I am charging for but in context it makes sense to listen to that first as a sneak peak and then check out part 2 which is about Steve getting revenge on his father and running into a glass table that his dad made with an SUV! Steve is going to be a regular on this show, do not mind his constant attempts at doing something illegal his brain cells are not all there! 

www.patreon.com/scumtown to support the podcast!! 

@vinnybeedle on instagram 
@scumbagvinny on TIK TOK 58,000 followers and counting !! you can also see the video of Steve hitting his dads table on either of those places! 

Thanks for listening I hope you enjoy boy episodes in one with my boy Steve
