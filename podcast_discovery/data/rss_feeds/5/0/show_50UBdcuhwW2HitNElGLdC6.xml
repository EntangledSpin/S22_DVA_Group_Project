			<title><![CDATA[#003 Living with a First Responder and a Life Mission to Make a Difference]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[In this episode, Angelique Finestone, a clinical psychology PhD student, discusses what is was like growing up with two parents who are first responders and the struggles she witnessed.  Because of some of the things she saw her parents endure, she knew her passion was to help other first responders with their mental health so her journey began to get her PhD.
Angelique is the wife of a veteran, who is also a police officer, and we discuss the hope for the destigmatization of mental health for the first responder community.  Angelique talks about her current work with the marginalized populations she is currently serving and the overlap she sees with the first responder community.
